###  Description
- 💡 The goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, applying concepts from abstract algebra, topology and scientific discovery to functional industrial implementations.
---

### 🛠️ The projects include a deep understanding of a wide range of architectures, from foundational concepts to the state of the art (SOTA):
- *Foundational Models:* Autoencoders, Clustering, CNNs, RNNs — fundamental for representation, pattern recognition and time series forecasting analysis.
- *Advanced Models:* NLP, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - for Problems Involving text, Anomaly Detection and Sequential decision-making.
- *Modern and Generative AI::* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs) and multimodal models, all with **Evaluation Metric** — Designed for specific tasks and content production.
- *ML/DL/AI Framewokrs:* Spark, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LangChain, LangGraph, JSON/TOON, RAGAS.
- *Tools:*  MCP, W&B/MLFlow, Kaggle, HuggingFace, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, VSCode, Jupyter, Databricks.

### 📌 Projects

- 🎨 🖼️ **[Generative AI - DiffusionModel_Text2Image](https://github.com/MoonQbit/Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Deep_Learning/DiffusionModel_Text2Image_Training.ipynb):** Implementation and training of a generative diffusion model for creating images from text descriptions (Text-to-Image).  
- 👨‍🏫➡️👨‍🎓 *[Knowledge_Distillation](https://github.com/MoonQbit/Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Deep_Learning/knowledge_Distillation_step_by_step.ipynb):* Detailed process for applying Knowledge Distillation, compressing a large "teacher" model into a lightweight and fast "student" model, optimized for inference in production and savings cost.
- 🕸️ 🔗 **[Graph Embeddings_ArXiv_Classifier_for_RAG](https://github.com/MoonQbit/Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Graph_Machine_Learning/Graph_Embedding_ArXiv_Classifier_for_RAG.ipynb):** Graph Embeddings to classify Scientific Articles from ArXiv based on their citations and relationships, taking advantage of the feasibility of an advanced RAG system.  
- 🛡️ 💬 *[Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/MoonQbit/Machine_Learning_Portfolio/blob/main/Reinforcement_Learning/ppo_llm_Reward_ToxicityMitigation.ipynb):* Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO) to train an Agent (such as an LLM), focused on toxicity mitigation by designing a Reward process using RoBERTa.

### 📌 Focus on MLOps

- Each project is designed as a complete MLOps pipeline, including BigData(Spark) & Cloud Services(GCP, AWS and Azure):
- Detailed documentation: from data ingestion and processing to algorithm selection, justification and results evaluation.
- Monitoring and traceability: integration with platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&B), compatible with MLflow.
- Critical metrics: tracking data drift, computational consumption and latency in Production.

### 🔒 Confidentiality and Deployment
<div align="center">
  Original data is not included due to confidentiality. Equivalent datasets are used to demonstrate implementation and these projects are designed to be deployed in cloud environments; integrating backend, frontend or AI to deliver business solutions.
